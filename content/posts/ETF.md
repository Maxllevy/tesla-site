# ETFs that don't include Tesla

For investors looking to gain market exposure without Tesla in their portfolio, several ETF options exist:

## CHGX - AXS Change Finance ESG ETF

People are more concerned about investing in good companies and avoiding those engaged in activities harmful to people and the planet. As shareholders, they can seek long-term growth while doing their part to change the world for the better. CHGX makes that possible.

AXS Change Finance ESG ETF (CHGX) provides environmentally and socially conscious investors diversified equity exposure to US companies that live up to the highest standards of environmental, social and governance (ESG) principles.

Does not currently include Tesla.

## Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA)

The Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets Index Fund ETF (VEA) seeks to track the performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from developed markets outside the United States. Since Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, VEA does not hold Tesla stock.

## Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)

The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, focusing on U.S. large-cap companies that are considered undervalued relative to the overall market. As of February 21, 2025, VTV's top holdings include companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Broadcom Inc. Tesla, Inc. is generally classified as a growth stock due to its rapid expansion and high valuation metrics, rather than a value stock. Consequently, Tesla is not among the holdings of the Vanguard Value ETF.

## iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA)

The iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI EAFE Investable Market Index, which encompasses large, mid, and small-cap companies across developed markets, excluding the United States and Canada. As Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, IEFA does not hold Tesla stock. As of the latest data, IEFA's top holdings include companies such as ASML Holding NV, Novo Nordisk A/S, and SAP SE.

## Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)

BND is a bond ETF, meaning it invests in a broad range of U.S. investment-grade bonds, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities. Since it focuses on fixed-income securities rather than equities, it does not include Tesla or any other stocks.

## Finding S&P 500 ETFs without Tesla

It's hard to find ETFs that follow the S&P 500 but don't include TSLA. You can check [etf.com](https://www.etf.com/stock/TSLA) for comprehensive information on ETF exposure to Tesla.

Some ETFs have less exposure to TSLA, and then the **AGF U.S. Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund (BTAL)** appears to be shorting TSLA.

From ChatGPT on the AGF U.S. Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund interest: The AGF U.S. Market Neutral Anti-Beta Fund (BTAL) is a fund that tries to make money by betting that less risky stocks (low-beta stocks) will do better than more risky stocks (high-beta stocks) over time. Tesla is considered a high-beta stock because its price goes up and down a lot compared to the overall market. Since this fund's strategy is to bet against high-risk stocks, it takes a "negative" (short) position in Teslaâ€”meaning it is betting Tesla's stock will underperform compared to safer stocks. So, when you see that the fund has "negative Tesla stock," it just means they borrow Tesla shares and sell them, hoping to buy them back later at a lower price to make a profit. This is part of their plan to balance out the market risk by holding both safe and risky stocks in a specific way.
