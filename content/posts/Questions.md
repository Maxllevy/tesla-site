## Musk Companies in Major Indices

**Q: Which Musk companies are in the S&P 500?**  
A: Tesla, Inc. (TSLA)

## Retirement Fund Exposure

**Q: What are the popular funds that people put retirement into (e.g., IRA and 401k) and what is the exposure to TSLA?**  
A: The top 6 ETFs hold over 293 million TSLA shares, currently valued at $99 billion and representing 9.13% of TSLA's market cap.

## S&P 500 Alternatives Without Tesla

**Q: Is there an ETF that behaves like the S&P with no Musk?**  

**Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA)**  
The Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets Index Fund ETF (VEA) seeks to track the performance of the FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index, which includes stocks from developed markets outside the United States. Since Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, VEA does not hold Tesla stock.

**Vanguard Value ETF (VTV)**  
The Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, focusing on U.S. large-cap companies that are considered undervalued relative to the overall market. As of February 21, 2025, VTV's top holdings include companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and Broadcom Inc. Tesla, Inc. is generally classified as a growth stock due to its rapid expansion and high valuation metrics, rather than a value stock. Consequently, Tesla is not among the holdings of the Vanguard Value ETF.

**iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA)**  
The iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI EAFE Investable Market Index, which encompasses large, mid, and small-cap companies across developed markets, excluding the United States and Canada. As Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, IEFA does not hold Tesla stock. As of the latest data, IEFA's top holdings include companies such as ASML Holding NV, Novo Nordisk A/S, and SAP SE.

**Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)**  
BND is a bond ETF, meaning it invests in a broad range of U.S. investment-grade bonds, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities. Since it focuses on fixed-income securities rather than equities, it does not include Tesla or any other stocks.

## Challenges Finding Suitable Alternatives

Having trouble funding this. Some have less exposure to TSLA, but I'm not sure if the ETF that we would need is out there. The reason why we are looking for an ETF that is S&P 500 minus TSLA is that we want to avoid giving any financial advice or directing people to an ETF like CHGX that is very different in terms of portfolio composition. A lot of Americans feel comfortable investing in the S&P 500 ETFs, so the alternative ETF needs to be the S&P 500 without TSLA to be the lowest risk and most similar to where their money already is. Some people might not feel comfortable moving to such a different portfolio on a whim, particularly with their life savings/retirement.

## Potential ETF Providers

I wonder if State Street Global Advisors might be a place to push for an S&P 500 minus TSLA, given this quote from their executive VP: "But once they go to market, if investors don't like them, they die on the vine. Every day, investors vote with their money and decide what's good and what's bad â€” that goes hand-in-hand with democratization."

They had the first ETF that actually stuck around and Vanguard's S&P 500 ETF (VOO) just overtook SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as the world's largest ETF.

## Strategic Questions

**Q: How much does it cost to create and manage a S&P 500 ETF?**

**Q: Would there be an incentive for State Street Global Advisors or Vanguard to create and S&P 500 ETF without Musk if people sold their current ETF and kept their money in the brokerage account (don't withdraw --> no taxes if in a tax-advantaged account) until it existed?**

**Q: What is the personal cost? Retirement accounts rely on years of investment appreciation - what is the impact of pausing this for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year?**

**Q: How expensive would it be for an investment manager to create the proposed ETF if they are already managing S&P 500 ETFs - would it be simple to remove TSLA from what they are already doing?**

## Proposed Strategy

Could the order of operations be:

- If in a Tax-Advantaged Account --> Move to lowest TSLA exposure S&P 500 ETFs and communicate to investment managers that you want to invest in an S&P 500 without TSLA
- For people who are making enough money to invest in retirement --> Emails, phone calls, booking investment advisor appointments, booking 401k manager advisor appointments letting them know that we want an S&P 500 without TSLA
- For people who are making enough money where they have a financial advisor, discussing with their financial advisor --> if enough financial advising clients are pushing for the S&P 500 without TSLA, would they be motivated to reach out to any contacts in investment management
- For anyone with contacts in investment management --> emails or phone calls to request an S&P 500 without TSLA
- For people without money in the stock market --> flyers, social media, also link to basic information (i.e.g, how to invest, brokerage accounts, ETFs, taxes) about retirement investing that is sometimes only learned if your family has enough money to invest

## Stakeholder Analysis

**Investment management companies interest:**  
Want people to invest money in their investment products (e.g., ETFs) and want the portfolio costs per person to be kept as low as possible. S&P 500 management costs are very low because the cost of management is spread across a high number of people (confirm?). 

An unanswered question - is it cheap for investment management companies to manage an S&P 500 ETF without TSLA (i.e., would it be a matter of just taking the money that would go towards TSLA stocks and redistributing it across the remaining holdings). 

If there was a high demand (people moving money out of existing investment products to demand for this ETF) and the cost was low, this could be an easy win for an investment management company to create an attractive financial product. There would be a risk (i.e., people who like Trump/Musk and move their money elsewhere. Risk mitigation strategy: Could we reduce this number by only focusing on Musk). 

Additionally, a smaller investment management company might be willing to carry that risk to break into the S&P 500 ETF product market. Additionally, you are creating an ETF product that lives up to the democratic promise mentioned by the State Street Global Advisor VP, and a way that people could invest in the S&P 500 (one of the most popular and accessible investment strategies), but drop TSLA (down the line maybe more or a different company ??).
