# How do taxes work with retirement and college accounts?

One of the benefits of retirement and college accounts—like IRAs and 529 accounts—is that the tax treatment of the money you earn is a little different. In many cases, you won't owe taxes on earnings until you take the money out of the account—or, depending on the type of account, ever.

This special tax treatment gives these accounts a significant advantage over regular taxable investment accounts, where you typically need to pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year you receive them.

## Tax implications when selling ETFs

An interesting question came up recently: Could someone sell an ETF, keep the money in the brokerage account, and not pay taxes until an ETF exists that is S&P 500 minus TSLA?

According to ChatGPT, the answer depends on the type of account:

### Taxable Brokerage Accounts

Selling an ETF for a gain in a taxable account will trigger capital gains taxes, even if the money stays in the account. The tax obligation is based on the sale transaction itself, not whether you withdraw the funds from the account.

When you sell an investment in a taxable account:
- You'll owe taxes on any profits in the year of the sale
- Short-term gains (assets held less than a year) are taxed at your ordinary income rate
- Long-term gains (assets held more than a year) are taxed at preferential capital gains rates

### Tax-Advantaged Accounts (IRA, 401(k), etc.)

If you sell investments within tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s, no taxes are due at the time of sale. You can buy and sell within these accounts without triggering immediate tax consequences.

- **Traditional IRA/401(k)**: Taxes are deferred until withdrawal, when you'll pay ordinary income tax
- **Roth IRA/401(k)**: No taxes on qualified withdrawals, since contributions were made with after-tax money

This tax-advantaged treatment is one of the primary benefits of retirement accounts, allowing your investments to grow without the drag of annual tax payments.
