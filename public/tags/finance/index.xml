&lt;p>One of the benefits of retirement and college accounts—like IRAs and 529 accounts—is that the tax treatment of the money you earn is a little different. In many cases, you won&amp;rsquo;t owe taxes on earnings until you take the money out of the account—or, depending on the type of account, ever.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This special tax treatment gives these accounts a significant advantage over regular taxable investment accounts, where you typically need to pay taxes on dividends, interest, and capital gains in the year you receive them.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
