Since Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, VEA does not hold Tesla stock.\nVanguard Value ETF (VTV)\nThe Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) seeks to track the performance of the CRSP US Large Cap Value Index, focusing on U.S. large-cap companies that are considered undervalued relative to the overall market. As of February 21, 2025, VTV’s top holdings include companies such as Berkshire Hathaway Inc., JPMorgan Chase \u0026 Co., and Broadcom Inc. Tesla, Inc. is generally classified as a growth stock due to its rapid expansion and high valuation metrics, rather than a value stock. Consequently, Tesla is not among the holdings of the Vanguard Value ETF.\niShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA)\nThe iShares Core MSCI EAFE ETF (IEFA) aims to replicate the performance of the MSCI EAFE Investable Market Index, which encompasses large, mid, and small-cap companies across developed markets, excluding the United States and Canada. As Tesla, Inc. is a U.S.-based company, it is not included in this index, and therefore, IEFA does not hold Tesla stock. As of the latest data, IEFA’s top holdings include companies such as ASML Holding NV, Novo Nordisk A/S, and SAP SE.\nVanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND)\nBND is a bond ETF, meaning it invests in a broad range of U.S. investment-grade bonds, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities. Since it focuses on fixed-income securities rather than equities, it does not include Tesla or any other stocks.\nChallenges Finding Suitable Alternatives Having trouble funding this. Some have less exposure to TSLA, but I’m not sure if the ETF that we would need is out there. The reason why we are looking for an ETF that is S\u0026P 500 minus TSLA is that we want to avoid giving any financial advice or directing people to an ETF like CHGX that is very different in terms of portfolio composition. A lot of Americans feel comfortable investing in the S\u0026P 500 ETFs, so the alternative ETF needs to be the S\u0026P 500 without TSLA to be the lowest risk and most similar to where their money already is. Some people might not feel comfortable moving to such a different portfolio on a whim, particularly with their life savings/retirement.\nPotential ETF Providers I wonder if State Street Global Advisors might be a place to push for an S\u0026P 500 minus TSLA, given this quote from their executive VP: “But once they go to market, if investors don’t like them, they die on the vine. Every day, investors vote with their money and decide what’s good and what’s bad — that goes hand-in-hand with democratization.”\nThey had the first ETF that actually stuck around and Vanguard’s S\u0026P 500 ETF (VOO) just overtook SPDR S\u0026P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) as the world’s largest ETF.\nStrategic Questions Q: How much does it cost to create and manage a S\u0026P 500 ETF?\nQ: Would there be an incentive for State Street Global Advisors or Vanguard to create and S\u0026P 500 ETF without Musk if people sold their current ETF and kept their money in the brokerage account (don’t withdraw –\u003e no taxes if in a tax-advantaged account) until it existed?\nQ: What is the personal cost? Retirement accounts rely on years of investment appreciation - what is the impact of pausing this for 3 months, 6 months, 1 year?\nQ: How expensive would it be for an investment manager to create the proposed ETF if they are already managing S\u0026P 500 ETFs - would it be simple to remove TSLA from what they are already doing?\nProposed Strategy Could the order of operations be:\nIf in a Tax-Advantaged Account –\u003e Move to lowest TSLA exposure S\u0026P 500 ETFs and communicate to investment managers that you want to invest in an S\u0026P 500 without TSLA For people who are making enough money to invest in retirement –\u003e Emails, phone calls, booking investment advisor appointments, booking 401k manager advisor appointments letting them know that we want an S\u0026P 500 without TSLA For people who are making enough money where they have a financial advisor, discussing with their financial advisor –\u003e if enough financial advising clients are pushing for the S\u0026P 500 without TSLA, would they be motivated to reach out to any contacts in investment management For anyone with contacts in investment management –\u003e emails or phone calls to request an S\u0026P 500 without TSLA For people without money in the stock market –\u003e flyers, social media, also link to basic information (i.e.g, how to invest, brokerage accounts, ETFs, taxes) about retirement investing that is sometimes only learned if your family has enough money to invest Stakeholder Analysis Investment management companies interest:\nWant people to invest money in their investment products (e.g., ETFs) and want the portfolio costs per person to be kept as low as possible. S\u0026P 500 management costs are very low because the cost of management is spread across a high number of people (confirm?).\nAn unanswered question - is it cheap for investment management companies to manage an S\u0026P 500 ETF without TSLA (i.e., would it be a matter of just taking the money that would go towards TSLA stocks and redistributing it across the remaining holdings).\nIf there was a high demand (people moving money out of existing investment products to demand for this ETF) and the cost was low, this could be an easy win for an investment management company to create an attractive financial product. There would be a risk (i.e., people who like Trump/Musk and move their money elsewhere. Risk mitigation strategy: Could we reduce this number by only focusing on Musk).\nAdditionally, a smaller investment management company might be willing to carry that risk to break into the S\u0026P 500 ETF product market. Additionally, you are creating an ETF product that lives up to the democratic promise mentioned by the State Street Global Advisor VP, and a way that people could invest in the S\u0026P 500 (one of the most popular and accessible investment strategies), but drop TSLA (down the line maybe more or a different company ??).\nRetirement investor interest:\n[Content pending]\nElon Musk interest:\n[Content pending]\n","wordCount":"1148","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2025-02-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2025-02-24T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/posts/questions/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Tesla","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/ accesskey=h title="Tesla (Alt + H)">Tesla</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/ title=Home><span>Home</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/ title=Posts><span>Posts</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=http://localhost:1313/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">S&amp;P 500 & Tesla Investment FAQ</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2025-02-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>February 24, 2025</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;6 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1148 words</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=musk-companies-in-major-indices>Musk Companies in Major Indices<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#musk-companies-in-major-indices>#</a></h2><p><strong>Q: Which Musk companies are in the S&amp;P 500?</strong><br>A: Tesla, Inc.
